| [PercyDan54](https://github.com/PercyDan54)                | Ultimate Scaler was once a fork of this contributor's project [Border Remover](https://github.com/PercyDan54/BorderRemover) | 2025-04-30              | Although Ultimate Scaler has become an independent project, many aspects still refer to the practices of Border Remover, such as the choice of loader and configuration file format. |
