**A Fabric mod for breaking the boundaries of Minecraft terrain generation and conducting in-depth research and exploration of terrain generation, especially the far lands and distance effects.**

> **Development Status: 🛠️ Refactoring in progress**

> We're modernizing our codebase and workflows with goals such as semantic version control, automated CI/CD pipelines, normalized commit history, and improved contributor guidelines.

## Technology Overview

This mod implements the following core capabilities through a series of underlying modifications to Minecraft's terrain generation system:

- **🧬 Terrain Offset**: Steadily offset the terrain at large scales by intercepting and modifying noise sampling coordinates. At present, it has been able to offset most terrain generations.
- **🔧 Distance Effects Fixes**: Fixed certain distance phenomena such as the "End Ring", abandoned mines not spawning, etc., and even fixed the far lands themselves.
- **🌐 Remove soft restrictions**: Remove various artificially set restrictions, such as world boundaries, coordinate values in commands, and certain values in data packs.
- **🔬 More Modifications**: Countless miscellaneous modifications, such as modifying values in noise sampling algorithms or recreating classic "sky grids".

Almost all functions are optional and can be turned on or off according to your needs.

## Start development

**Environment Configuration:**
- **JDK 21+**
- **Fabric Toolchain**
- **Dependencies**: Fabric API (runtime), Cloth Config API (optional, for GUI)

**Quick Build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/INF32768/UltimateScaler.git

cd UltimateScaler

./gradlew build
```

Then, find the jar file in the `build/libs` directory (select the one without `source` in the file name) and put it in the `.minecraft/mods` directory.

**Configuration file**: `.minecraft/config/ultimate_scaler.toml` (You can open the configuration GUI in the game using a hotkey, which is `Ctrl U` by default. If you manually modify the configuration file, you can execute the `/reload` command in the game for it to take effect.)

**Contribution:** We welcome all contributions, including issue reports, feature suggestions, and code commits. Before you begin, please read the [Contribution Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Nightly builds

![AppVeyor Build](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/build/inf32768/ultimatescaler-nightly)

Want to experience or test the latest code changes? If there is a code change on a given day, we release a nightly build that night or the next day.

The nightly build binaries are deployed on a **unified GitHub Release page**. Click [here](https://github.com/INF32768/UltimateScaler/releases/latest) and follow the instructions to download the files.

These builds include the latest features and fixes, but may also contain unstable changes. **Do not use for production environments.**

## Compatibility Notes

- **Supported Versions**:![CurseForge Game Versions](https://img.shields.io/curseforge/game-versions/1323296)
- **Compatibility**:
- ✅ Compatible with terrain generation modifications based on data packs, for which offset algorithms take effect (e.g. _The Aether_).
- ⚠️ Compatible with mod parts generated by injected modified terrain, offset algorithms are usually not effective, but can coexist (e.g. _Modern Beta_).
- ❌ Not compatible with mods that invasively modify terrain generation, while loading causes the game to crash or various strange issues (e.g. _Concurrent Chunk Management Engine_).
